#Isometric landscapes in Canvas
I am a big fan of old isometric games (Pharaoh, Theme Hospital, Age of Empires) and this repo is about me having fun in my spare time with canvas and sometric view. It is a lot of fun because there is a lot of mathematics included and it is completely different from what I usually program.

##JSON Maps
You can specify your map as a JSON arrays. For example the following map has two layers. `G` stands for grass, `W` for water, `R` for rock and `T` for a tree. This is of course configurable.

##Render only the current viewport
So far my favourite feature is rendering only what is in the viewport. This ensures smooth rendering even with gigantic maps. There is just something visually pleasing to see the objects disappear and then appear again :-)
