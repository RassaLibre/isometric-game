#Isometric landscapes in Canvas
I am a big fan of old isometric games (Pharaoh, Theme Hospital, Age of Empires) and this repo is about me having fun in my spare time with canvas and sometric view. It is a lot of fun because there is a lot of mathematics included and it is completely different from what I usually program.
